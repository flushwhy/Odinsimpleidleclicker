# Odin Idle Clicker

So I am building a prototype Indle Clicker in Odin and Raylib. The goal is to change it a lot before each release to show different concepts in idle clickers.

It will follow a standard versioning with a twist. Any update that releases a major update I am going to use the major verison code, and any patches will be the Minor, but I am not going deeper than that.

## Version one

Single miner, and a button very basic. 

Nothing fancy.

## Version two

Added more miners, and changed the name from Gold to Aurum (Gold ore and Aurum is the currency)
Redid the interface
